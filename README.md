# CryptoClustering

Project Overview
This project conducts an analysis of cryptocurrency market data through K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify distinct groups of cryptocurrencies based on their market performance metrics.

Features
Data Preprocessing with StandardScaler.
Dimensionality Reduction using PCA.
Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means.
Visualization of clustering results with hvplot.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Hvplot
Jupyter Notebook or Lab

Usage
The analysis is structured as follows:

Load the cryptocurrency market data.
Normalize the data features.
Apply PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensions.
Perform K-Means clustering on the processed data.
Visualize the results using interactive plots.
Run the Jupyter notebooks to go through the analysis steps.
